Introduction
 The program is used for defragmentation of disk image files with FAT32 file system. It is split into several
 modules, from that each can  work with its "problem domain". These modules cooperate with each other.
 My aim was to hide as many functions as it is possible, in order I would achieve the biggest "encapsulation"
 (even if the C language is not object oriented). It allowed simplier program debuging.
 
 While writting this project I was thinking on the motto: Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS).
 In case of any questions, please write me on my email pjakubco@gmail.com

Program compiling
 In order to simplify the compilation I have used the make program and I have created Makefile file. Programs are
 written for gcc compiler and there are needed also two programs to be installed: sed and xgettext.
 
 The xgettext program is used for automatical retrieving of strings that will be localized and therefore multilanguage
 is supproted. Additional translation and creation of binary localization file is needed to perform manually. Currently,
 there are supported 2 languages: English and Slovak.

Release notes
 
        v0.1b (12.11.2006)
          Fixed all relevant bugs, command line parameters added
	v0.1a (4.11.2006) 
	  simple defragmentation, manipulates with single cluster.
	  Not functioning checking of FAT table, working only with FAT32.
         Algorithm as in Windows (pushes everything on the beginning)

System requirements
 The software needs any distribution of UNIX/LINUX that contains tools: gcc, make, xgettext, and sed.
